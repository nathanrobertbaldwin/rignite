Rignite 

Rignite partners with 3rd party companies to create interesting products aimed at pc-builder enthusiasts. 
Once 3rd party companies develop a product idea, the product is posted to the Rignite website. 
Customers can then vote on whether or not they want to join in on the product run order. 
Once enough votes are cast to join on a product run, the product run is funded.
